Configuring it
##############

The DDH behavior is set in a single configuration file named `'ddh.json'`.
In the following snippet, we highlight the most important lines.

    {
        "comment": "auto-generated by DDH setup tab, do not edit",
        "db_logger_macs": {
            "60:77:71:22:C8:08": "2006671",
            "60:77:71:22:C8:18": "house",
        },
        "ship_name": "My boat!",
        "forget_time": 86400,
        "forget_time_at_sea": 900,
        "units": "F",
        "hci_if": 0,
        ...
        }
    }


The 'db_logger_macs' entry contains the whitelist of loggers which a DDH
recognizes and will query upon detection. Each logger entry comprises its MAC
address and its friendly name.


Line 8, 'forget_time', in seconds, represents for how long a DDH will ignore a
logger once it is detected, downloaded and re-configured. This prevents the DDH from
constantly detecting and interacting with the same loggers. This setting
is for when the DDH is inland, or maybe at a lab.


Line 9, 'forget_time_at_sea', represents the same concept as 'forget_time'. However,
this value is used when the DDH is at sea. This setting prevents the DDH from ignoring
a logger too much time when it is being transferred from one location
at sea to the next one. An excessively long value, such as forget_time, could
make the DDH log the last location of the logger as too far away.


Line 10, 'units', allows the data plots to be shown in 'F', for Fahrenheit, or 'C', for Celsius.


Line 11, 'hci_if', allows the DDH to user an external HCI Linux interface when set as 1, or an
internal one, when set as 0 as in the example. An external HCI Linux Bluetooth interface
is commonly a USB dongle, which needs to implement Bluetooth Low Energy.


The 'ddh.json' file is longer, although the rest of parameters have been omitted
from this explanation since they are not intended to be modified by the final user.
