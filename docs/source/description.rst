Description
===========

The Deck Data Hub, or DDH, is wireless IoT system intended for use by commercial fishing boats
to aggregate data from IoT sensors and devices previously deployed in their operation areas.
The system works completely unattended, detecting nearby wireless loggers, downloading, re-configuring
and setting them up for the next deployment in a completely automatic manner. Their data is then uploaded
to cloud services. The entire system can operate without a single intervention from the user. However,
the interface also provides tailored capabilities to access real-time and historical data.

The DDH system is comprised by hardware and software parts, which we describe next.
